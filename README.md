Lab 5 Sudoku
This lab is about creating a class to contain a Sudoku puzzle. In Part 2, the program should read in input from a file to create and display the puzzle.  In Part 3, the program should allow the user to insert numbers into the empty spaces of the puzzle in order to solve it, and the program should inform the user if that is a valid place to put the number.
